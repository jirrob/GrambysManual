<div id="basics"><h2> Basics </h2></div>
<p> This game has a lot of essential basics you have to know to know how to get good at the game. Here's some very popular basic questions i'll answer here. Q stands for Question and A stands for Answer.
<ul>
 <li> Q: Why is the game not loading for me?? </li>
 <li> A: This is a bug that was patched in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5819143869/Gramby-Test">gramby test</a>. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: Whats a "Mount"? </li>
 <li> A: A mount is one of those yellow attachment points on building blocks, or other builds, where you can attach things to it. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: Why is someone hopping at light speed in my game??? </li>
 <li> A: This is another bug that was patched in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5819143869/Gramby-Test">gramby test</a>. </li>
 <br>
 <li>Q: How far away is gramby?? </li>
 <li> A: Gramby is 115 miles away from spawn. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: How do I change toolgun mode??? </li>
 <li> A: You hold Q or E and scroll up or down, or you do Shift+Q or E in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5819143869/Gramby-Test">gramby test</a>. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: Why did my pie explode when I spawned it in??? </li>
 <li> A: Its a reference to a spongebob episode, where if you flip a pie upside down and it touches anything - it explodes. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: What do the things under the hood of my car do?? </li>
 <li> A: The fish tank (left most item) acts as coolant adding or removing fuel from it does nothing but your car will run without it. Potato engine (middle item) does not have fuel but it is essential to run your car, Spring Juice (right most item) controls the suspension of your car adding fuel will make your suspension weaker and longer while removing fuel makes your suspension stiffer and shorter it is essential to run your car aswell. </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: Why is my car not running?? </li>
 <li> A: It could be missing an essential part that it needs to run, the minimum amount of things a car needs to run is listed as such - 1 seat, steering wheel (only essential for turning, or any item you can put on the car), potato engine, and fuel in chassis (if it needs fuel) </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q: There is a giant hole in the ground how do I get past it?? </li>
 <li> A: That giant hole is a ravine that spawns in every server that you must get past to progress,  you will have to fly over it using thrusters and balloons or you will have to leave your car behind and walk the rest of the way </li>
 <br>
 <li> Q:Why cant i attach the brief case to anything? </li>
 <li> A:The brief case is a loose item meaning that you cant attach it directly to anything without the use of a joust or plunger. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p> That is most frequent questions answered, now we'll move onto basic things like how to rotate spinners, how to power a light, etc. </p>
 <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>The spinner</li>
 </ul>
 </div>
<img src="./images2/spinner.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 15px 15px; cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; border:0" width="479" height="143" alt="" />

<p>  The bearing / spinner is an item which rotates the things on it. To power a bearing and make it spin in the direction you want it to spin in, you have to first spawn in a switch, and then place the spinner on the circle-shaped switch spot. You can ignore the switch for now, other that it can be activated to make the spinner spin, as we're going to go over the switch and wiring in the <a href="#wiring">wiring</a> category. 
<br>
In order to make it spin the way you want to, you need to press Shift+E/Q on it and turn on reverse, if its not already going in the right direction. </p>
 <br> <img src="./images2/spinner_rotate.PNG" style="float:left; margin:0px 0px 15px 0px; cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; border:0" width="130" height="123" alt="" /> <p> I recommend you focus on this item as it becomes important in building cars and other things as such.</p>

 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Fuel</li>
 </ul>
 </div> <img src="./images2/refuel.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 20px 15px 15px; cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; border:0" width="267" height="215" alt="" />
 <p> You're probably wondering how to refuel your chassis, or thruster. Fuel is one of the most important aspects for machines that move in this game using fuel centered objects, like a thruster. You can refuel them using any item that has fuel measured in Liters (L), but the recommended items are "canister" and "jug" by picking the canister or jug up, bringing them over to the thing you have to refuel, and holding e or q on them, depending on which hand you have the canister or jug in. There is another way to refuel things, but we'll discuss it in the <a href="#building">building</a> category. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div id="building"><h2> Building </h2></div>
<p> This is the category where you start learning a lot more things, things that you can't miss out on. </p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Connector</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The connector is one of the most important building items you will need in the game, as it has 5 attachment points on all sides (except the bottom, which gets covered up by whatever you attach it to) and is one of the most lightweight items in the game. Most talented builders use it as one of the bases for their builds, usually covering it up with another item we'll go over later. The connector is also 0.6x0.6x0.6 in size, measured in studs.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Part</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The part is a light gray block, resembling a default roblox part. It is 1x1x1 in size measured in studs. This is a heavier and slightly bigger version of the connector, which builders usually don't use due to its weight in builds that are based around aircraft.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Sticks</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>This game has 3 different sticks in total, all at different sizes, each one getting larger and larger, the list of them goes as follows; Short Stick, Stick, Long Stick.  The short stick is 1 part (stud) long. The stick is 4 parts long. The long stick is 8 parts long. Builders combine these items with the connector for builds.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Bases</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p> The base is one of the heaviest items in the game, having the material of wood and being yellow-ish when spawned in. Some people use it on builds to cover up the "exoskeleton" or to use it as a floor of sort.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Hoods</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>This was the item i was talking about in the connector description, it is the hood that covers up the engine of a normal chassis when you spawn in, if you have the question "Why not trunks instead??", the answer is that trunks are smaller than hoods are.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Pipes</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>This is something most people in the community don't know about, connectors and sticks send fuel through them if they're placed on a fuel tank, and they will send the fuel to anything that is on the connectors / sticks.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Servo and Simulated servo</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p> This part will require a bit of wiring, but it shouldn't be too hard for now. You can always check on the <a href="#wiring">wiring</a> category if you're too confused. A servo is basically like a bearing, but it only moves on command, meaning you can build turrets, which are solely and purefully controlled by you. The difference between a servo and a simulated servo is that the servo turns in increments, and the simulated servo moves. To power a servo / simulated servo, you must put an output of something that can emit a signal onto the red or blue part. The blue part is counter clockwise rotation, the red part is clockwise rotation. </p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>The toolgun</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>This item is a builder's best friend, it can save builds, rotate items attached to something, move builds, all only using shift+e or q. If you want to make a good build - I really recommend you use the rotate tool to bend the limitations of the shapes the game offers you. Remember to be unique!</p>
<div id="wiring"><h2> Wiring </h2> </div>
<p> This is where you learn how to do the most sacred thing in road to gramby's, wiring. Wiring is complex at first in this game, but you easily can get it after. I'll go over the basics of it. </p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Input and Output</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The input is the button you press to activate the output, when you activate the input, the output activates whatever is on the output. Inputs usually wary from splitters to buttons, but all outputs are always small little circles with one mount on them.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Button</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The button item is the most basic wiring item that has a input and output, as I said, it does what is specified in the Input and Output.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>The splitters</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The splitters are items, which act like buttons, but with more than one output. Imagine a fork but for wiring. Theres 4 different splitter, 1 output splitter, 2 output splitter, 3 output splitter, and 4 output splitter. You can stack splitters on eachother's outputs in case you want to have more than 4 outputs. The splitter's input also has a mount.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Switch</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The switch is like a button, but it holds the signal for as long as until you turn it off, think of a lightswitch for example. It has only one output.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Remote button</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>Works exactly like a normal button, but its remote (infinite range).</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Delayer</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The delayer is a wiring item, which delays the signal of an output being sent to something if added, it can be configured using SHIFT+E/Q</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Input sensor</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The input sensor is a wiring item which activates when you are seated and the seat is attached to the same build that the input sensor is on. This can be achieved with remote buttons, if you dont want the builds to be connected. To configure the input sensor, use SHIFT+E/Q</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Tripwire</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The tripwire item resembles a laser with 1 output, if it detects anything, it will activate the output.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Wire</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
 <p>Used for logic gates / extending wire ropes.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Entity Sensor</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The entity sensor is a item which detects where the nearest player it can find is,the main point it uses is the little green stick pointing out of the base. To make it function, put splitters / buttons / switches on the buttons saying right / left / up / down / front / back, if you go in those directions, the signal will activate, people usually use this with servos for turrets.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Altitude and Velocity sensor.</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The altitude and velocity sensors activate when they reach a certain altitude (height) or velocity (speed). You can configure them using SHIFT+E/Q.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Looper</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The looper is a wiring item which activates every certain seconds, which can be configured using SHIFT+E/Q. To make the looper send an output - you need to put a button / switch / splitter on any of its sides.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Pressure Plates</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The pressure plates are a pretty bad physics item, which activates when something is on it. I don't recommend using it, due to how buggy it is.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>Detacher</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>The detacher detaches anything that is on it if it gets a signal using e / q or a signal using a button / splitter / switch output.</p>
<div id="awiring"><h2> Advanced Wiring </h2> </div>
<p> This is where you learn how logic gates function, for building computers and such. The main topic of advanced wiring are Logic Gates.</p>  
<br>
<p>The main logic gates when you spawn in the game are NOT, AND, & OR gates.</p> <img src="./images2/gates.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 20px 15px 15px; cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; border:0" width="235" height="280" alt="" />
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>NOT gate</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>Reverses signal of the output that is on it.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>AND gate</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>Activates output only if both inputs are on.</p> 
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>OR gate</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>Activates output if one or both of the inputs are on.</p>
<br>
<p>Those are all of the basics gate, so i'll move onto the other gates, which can be built using pre-existing gates.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>XOR (Exclusive OR) gate</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>This is a OR gate, which only activates if one of the inputs is on, if both or none are on, it sends no output. It can be built using 2 NOT gates, 2 AND gates, and 1 final OR gate.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>NAND (NOT+AND) gate</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>This gate is the easiest to build, its a AND gate, which has its output hooked to a NOT gate, so it reverses the signal. It activates at any circumstance except when both inputs are on.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>NOR (NOT+OR) gate</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>This gate is as easy as the NAND gate to build, its a OR gate, which has its output hooekd to a NOT gate, so it reverses the signal. It only activates when none of the inputs are on.</p>
  <div class="item">
 <ul>
 <li>XNOR (XOR+NOR) gate</li>
 </ul>
  </div>
<p>This gate is the hardest to build, as it takes 4 NOR gates. It activates only if both or none of the inputs are on, if only one is on, it will not activate.</p>
<div id="b64"><h2> Base64 / Codes </h2> </div>
<p> This is where you learn on how base64 works, the encoding language road to gramby's uses to save codes. Whenever you save a build, it will have a "share code" which you can copy to friends and they can spawn it in. This is made possible thanks to Base64, a encoding language that encodes normal text into strings like W10wSxiz2= and etc. My program 'Gramby's Workshop' actually uses the system of base64 decoding and then encoding, so you can build things in gramby's workshop, and import them into the main game. You can modify colors in [R,G,B] and rotation [X,Y,Z] using base64. The site I <recom></recom>mend using is <a href="https://www.base64decode.org/">base64decode.org</a></p>
<div id="physics"><h2> Physics </h2> </div>
<p> This is where you learn the physics of almost every item and how they cooperate. </p>
